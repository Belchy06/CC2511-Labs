Module "Pins1"     (component PinSettings)

Module "FC"        (component FreeCntr32)
   - FC_Reset -This method clears the counter.
   - FC_GetTimeUS -This method returns the time (as a 16-bit unsigned integer) in microseconds since the last resetting after 
                the last reset.
   - FC_GetTimeMS -This method returns the time (as a 16-bit unsigned integer) in milliseconds since the last resetting after 
                the last reset.

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU1_ResetCounter -Resets counter. If counter is counting up then it is set to zero. If counter is counting down then 
                counter is updated to the reload value.   The method is not available if HW doesn't allow resetting of the 
                counter.

Module "Term1"     (component Term)
   - Term1_CRLF -Send CRLF to terminal.
   - Term1_SendStr -Send string to terminal.
   - Term1_SendNum -Send number to terminal.
   - Term1_SendFloatNum -Send a float number to the terminal. Due to the transformations the maximum float number is limited 
                according to the following conditions:     - positive number: 9 digits for integer part with 4 digits for 
                fractional part.     - negative numbers: 8 digits for integer part with 4 digits for fractional part.
   - Term1_SendChar -Send char to terminal.
   - Term1_Cls -Clear the terminal window.
   - Term1_MoveTo -Move cursor to position x, y. Range of coordinates can be from 1 to the size, which depends on the used 
                terminal. Position [1,1] represents the upper left corner.
   - Term1_ReadChar -Read char from terminal.
   - Term1_KeyPressed -Test if char was received from the terminal.
