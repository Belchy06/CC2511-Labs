Module "Pins1"     (component PinSettings)

Module "Terminal"  (component Term)
   - Terminal_CRLF -Send CRLF to terminal.
   - Terminal_SendStr -Send string to terminal.
   - Terminal_SendNum -Send number to terminal.
   - Terminal_SendChar -Send char to terminal.
   - Terminal_Cls -Clear the terminal window.
   - Terminal_MoveTo -Move cursor to position x, y. Range of coordinates can be from 1 to the size, which depends on the used 
                terminal. Position [1,1] represents the upper left corner.
   - Terminal_ReadChar -Read char from terminal.
   - Terminal_KeyPressed -Test if char was received from the terminal.

Module "ADC"       (component ADC)
   - ADC_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - ADC_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - ADC_Calibrate -This method starts self calibration process. Calibration is typically used to remove the effects of the 
                gain and offset from a specific reading.

Module "Cpu"       (component MK22FN512DC12)
